Viral databases
Three databases that were used to search for viruses are provided
(1) RefSeq reference human viruses, downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 76, to which we added human papillomaviruses strains that are not in RefSeq from PAVE (https://pave.niaid.nih.gov) - provided as human_virus_db.fa

(2) more divergent viruses obtained from RVDB80 which was then filtered to remove non-viral elements, endogenous viruses, and accessions that were consistently not verified using blastn against the nonredundant (nr) blast nucleotide database. The complete database is available for download C-RVDBv16.0.fasta from: https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/rvdb/
Where accessions that were filtered out provided as filtered_accessions.csv

(3) Human endogenous viruses. HERVd from (https://herv.img.cas.cz) where we found  at least one identified retroviral protein motif of: POL/RT, GAG or ENV are provided as herv_db.fa
